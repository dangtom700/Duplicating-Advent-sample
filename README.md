# Duplicating-Advent-sample

For this time, I want to try out duplicating files by using different languages. In this project, I have already vreated beforehand some template files to solve Advent of Code problems. 

To make sure that I have created unique files and folders to not conflicting with other files I am currently working on. I have created a format to have a unique name for every individual files: "Advent_of_code_(year)_(date)ouput.(languages)".

To make sure it is easy to managing files, I created all of them under a particular folder, which I called MAIN_ROOT folder. To make it easier for me to navigate through files, I created sub-folders with the following format: "Advent_of_code_(year)". The year is in range from 2015 to the current year. Then, create multiple sub-folders under "Advent_of_code_(year)" with the following format:"Advent_of_code_(year)_(date)". Finally creating files under "Advent_of_code_(year)_(date)" sub-folders with the follwing format: "Advent_of_code_(year)_(date)output.(languages)" and creating an extra Puzzle Input file with following format: "Advent_of_code_(year)_(date)PuzzleInput.txt". 

To make sure that these versions of folder-and-files-duplicators is working in large scale, I want to put all the sample files/ templates files in the same directories that duplicator is working. These version of duplicators can take as many inputs as I want, with the assumption that I can correctly type in the name of all the template files that I want to duplicate.
